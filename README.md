# CrossPoint Reader - UNSTABLE FORK DRIFT - VERY EXPERIMENTAL

Firmware for the **Xteink X4** e-paper display reader (unaffiliated with Xteink).
Built using **PlatformIO** and targeting the **ESP32-C3** microcontroller.

This is the **`fork-drift`** branch. It tracks upstream while adding fork-specific capabilities (notably the web build configurator and modular feature profiles).

## Build Configurator

The **[Build Configurator](https://unintendedsideeffects.github.io/crosspoint-reader/configurator/)** is the primary entry point for this fork.

Because the ESP32-C3 has limited flash and RAM, the configurator lets you choose only the features you need and generates matching build flags.

- Presets: `Lean`, `Standard`, `Full`
- Per-feature toggles with dependency enforcement
- Flash-size budgeting and generated `platformio-custom.ini`
- Direct bridge to forked web flasher/debug tools

## Fork-Drift Additions vs Upstream

Compared with `upstream/master`, this branch adds fork-specific user-facing capabilities:

- Web Build Configurator UI (`docs/configurator`) for custom firmware composition
- Modular compile-time feature flag system (`include/FeatureFlags.h`, `src/FeatureManifest.h`)
- Markdown/Obsidian reader pipeline (`lib/Markdown`, `MarkdownReaderActivity`)
- TODO planner activities and daily storage flow (`src/activities/todo`)
- Background web server runtime modes (`src/network/BackgroundWebServer.*`)
- Web Wi-Fi setup + BLE provisioning flow (`src/network/BleWifiProvisioner.*`)
- USB Mass Storage mode integration (`ENABLE_USB_MASS_STORAGE`)
- User font pipeline (`UserFontManager` + CPF tooling under `tools/font-converter/`)
- Home UI variants exposed via configurator (Home Media Picker / Lyra / Visual Covers)
- Fork plugin surfaces (including web Pokedex plugin page)
- Fork release-channel/configuration docs and OTA catalog metadata (`docs/ota`, configurator docs)

For full branch intent and maintenance model, see [`docs/fork-strategy.md`](./docs/fork-strategy.md).

## Fork Branch Strategy

This repository tracks upstream while keeping dedicated branches for specific goals:

- `master`: Synchronized with upstream `crosspoint-reader/master`.
- `fork-drift`: Active development for experimental and fork-specific capabilities (configurator, plugins, and UI drift).

For the full rationale, see [`docs/fork-strategy.md`](./docs/fork-strategy.md).

## Features & Usage

- EPUB parsing/rendering (EPUB 2 and EPUB 3)
- Image support within EPUB
- Saved reading position
- File explorer with nested folders and cover-art picker
- Custom sleep screens (cover/BMP/PNG/JPEG; optional plugin hooks)
- Wi-Fi book upload + OTA updates
- Configurable font/layout/display options (including user-provided CPF fonts)
- Screen rotation and dark mode
- Optional Markdown/Obsidian reader flow
- Optional KOReader + Calibre integration flows
- Optional TODO planner flow
- Optional USB Mass Storage mode

See [the user guide](./USER_GUIDE.md) for instructions on operating CrossPoint.

## Installing

### Web Configurator (Recommended)

1. Go to the **[Build Configurator](https://unintendedsideeffects.github.io/crosspoint-reader/configurator/)**.
2. Select features and click **Build on GitHub**.
3. Once the build completes, download the `firmware.bin` or use the browser-based flasher.

### Quick Flash (Latest Stable)

1. Connect your Xteink X4 to your computer via USB-C.
2. Go to [xteink.dve.al](https://xteink.dve.al/) and click **"Flash CrossPoint firmware"**.

To revert to official firmware, use the "Swap boot partition" button at [xteink.dve.al/debug](https://xteink.dve.al/debug).

### Web (Specific Firmware Version)

1. Connect your Xteink X4 via USB-C
2. Download `firmware.bin` from the [releases page](https://github.com/Unintendedsideeffects/crosspoint-reader/releases)
3. Flash it via [xteink.dve.al](https://xteink.dve.al/) (OTA fast flash controls)

## Development

### Prerequisites

* **PlatformIO Core** (`pio`) or **VS Code + PlatformIO IDE**
* Python 3.8+
* USB-C cable for flashing the ESP32-C3
* Xteink X4

### Checking out the code

CrossPoint uses PlatformIO for building and flashing the firmware. To get started, clone the repository:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader

# Or, if you've already cloned without --recursive:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Flashing your device

Connect your Xteink X4 to your computer via USB-C and run the following command.

```sh
pio run --target upload
```
### Debugging

After flashing the new features, it’s recommended to capture detailed logs from the serial port.

First, make sure all required Python packages are installed:

```python
python3 -m pip install pyserial colorama matplotlib
```
after that run the script:
```sh
# For Linux
# This was tested on Debian and should work on most Linux systems.
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py

# For macOS
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py /dev/cu.usbmodem2101
```
Minor adjustments may be required for Windows.

## Internals

CrossPoint Reader is pretty aggressive about caching data down to the SD card to minimise RAM usage. The ESP32-C3 only
has ~380KB of usable RAM, so we have to be careful. A lot of the decisions made in the design of the firmware were based
on this constraint.

### Data caching

The first time chapters of a book are loaded, they are cached to the SD card. Subsequent loads are served from the 
cache. This cache directory exists at `.crosspoint` on the SD card. The structure is as follows:


```
.crosspoint/
├── epub_12471232/       # Each EPUB is cached to a subdirectory named `epub_<hash>`
│   ├── progress.bin     # Stores reading progress (chapter, page, etc.)
│   ├── cover.bmp        # Book cover image (once generated)
│   ├── book.bin         # Book metadata (title, author, spine, table of contents, etc.)
│   └── sections/        # All chapter data is stored in the sections subdirectory
│       ├── 0.bin        # Chapter data (screen count, all text layout info, etc.)
│       ├── 1.bin        #     files are named by their index in the spine
│       └── ...
│
└── epub_189013891/
```

Deleting the `.crosspoint` directory will clear the entire cache. 

Due the way it's currently implemented, the cache is not automatically cleared when a book is deleted and moving a book
file will use a new cache directory, resetting the reading progress.

For more details on the internal file structures, see the [file formats document](./docs/file-formats.md).
