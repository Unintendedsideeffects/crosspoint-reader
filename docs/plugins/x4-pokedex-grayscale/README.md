# X4 Grayscale Pokedex Wallpaper (Companion Plugin)

This companion plugin vendors and constrains:
- Upstream: https://github.com/m86-tech/BOOX-Pokedex-Wallpaper-Generator
- Commit: `2cadbb360a42c460c15dd6461185a3c98df7e40c`

CrossPoint-specific constraints in this variant:
- Locked resolution: `480 x 800` (XTEink X4)
- Grayscale sprite rendering is always enabled
- Single-image `.bmp` export is always used
- Batch-generation and multi-device controls are hidden

Open `index.html` in a browser and generate wallpapers for the `/sleep/pokedex/` folder.
The generated `.bmp` files should be copied to `sleep/pokedex` on the SD card.
