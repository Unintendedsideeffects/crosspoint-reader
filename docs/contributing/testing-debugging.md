# Testing and Debugging

CrossPoint runs on real hardware, so debugging usually combines local build checks and on-device logs.

## Local Static Analysis

Before flashing, run the built-in static analysis tools to catch common errors:

```sh
./bin/clang-format-fix
pio check --fail-on-defect low --fail-on-defect medium --fail-on-defect high
pio run
```

## Logging and Monitoring

### Logging Macros

We use a structured logging system defined in `lib/Logging/Logging.h`. Avoid using `Serial.print()` directly. Instead, use:

- `LOG_ERR(origin, format, ...)`: For critical errors.
- `LOG_INF(origin, format, ...)`: For general information (e.g., activity transitions).
- `LOG_WRN(origin, format, ...)`: For warnings that don't stop execution.
- `LOG_DBG(origin, format, ...)`: For detailed debugging information.

The `origin` parameter is a short string identifying the module (e.g., `"EPUB"`, `"WIFI"`).

### Standard Serial Monitor

```sh
pio device monitor
```

### Enhanced Debugging Monitor

For a more powerful monitoring experience, including colorized logs and potential visualization, use the custom monitor script:

```sh
# Ensure dependencies are installed
python3 -m pip install pyserial colorama matplotlib

# Run the monitor
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py
```

## Resource Monitoring

Memory management is critical on the ESP32-C3. Use these calls to monitor resource usage:

- **Heap Usage**: `ESP.getFreeHeap()` returns the available heap memory in bytes.
- **Stack Usage**: `uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark(NULL)` returns the minimum amount of remaining stack space (in words) that has been available since the task started. A low value (e.g., < 200) indicates a potential stack overflow.

## Troubleshooting

### Cache Invalidation

If you notice inconsistent behavior in the reader or library, try clearing the on-disk cache on the SD card:

```sh
# Remove the cache directory
rm -rf /sdcard/.crosspoint/
```

The firmware will automatically recreate the necessary structures on the next boot.

### CI Workflows

The project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration. Every PR triggers several workflows:
- **Build**: Verifies that the code compiles for the target hardware.
- **CI**: Runs static analysis and formatting checks.
- **Feature Matrix**: Tests various combinations of build flags.

You can view the status of these workflows in the **Actions** tab of the repository.

## Useful Bug Report Contents

- **Firmware version**: Look for the version string in the boot logs.
- **Exact steps**: Provide a numbered list of actions leading to the issue.
- **Serial logs**: Capture logs from boot through the failure point.
- **Crash report**: If the device panicked, check `/crash_report.txt` on the SD card.
