# Development Workflow

This page defines the expected local workflow before opening a pull request.

## 1) Fork and Create a Focused Branch

- Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
- Clone your fork locally and add the upstream repository.
- **Target Branch**: All PRs must target the **`fork-drift`** branch.
- **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive prefixes for your branches:
  - `feature/` for new functionality.
  - `fix/` for bug fixes.
  - `refactor/` for code restructuring.
  - `docs/` for documentation updates.

Example: `git checkout -b feature/anki-sync-integration`

## 2) Implement with Scope in Mind

- Confirm your idea is in project scope: [SCOPE.md](../../SCOPE.md)
- Prefer incremental changes over broad refactors.
- Adhere to the project's C++20 standards and naming conventions.

## 3) Commit Messages

We use semantic commit messages to keep the history clean and readable. Start your commit message with one of the following prefixes:

- `feat:` (new feature)
- `fix:` (bug fix)
- `docs:` (documentation changes)
- `refactor:` (code refactoring)
- `test:` (adding or updating tests)
- `chore:` (maintenance tasks)

Example: `feat: add support for custom user fonts`

## 4) Git Hooks

The project includes git hooks in `scripts/hooks/` to automate checks. You should install them to ensure your changes meet project standards:

```sh
# Install hooks (from project root)
cp scripts/hooks/* .git/hooks/
chmod +x .git/hooks/*
```

- **`pre-commit`**:
  - Automatically runs `clang-format`.
  - Guards against manual edits to `I18nStrings.cpp` (which is generated).
  - Validates HTML headers in the web server source.
- **`pre-push`**:
  - Runs `pio check` (static analysis).
  - Performs a local `pio run` build to ensure compilation success.

## 5) Manual Local Checks

If you don't use the hooks, run these manually before pushing:

```sh
./bin/clang-format-fix
pio check --fail-on-defect low --fail-on-defect medium --fail-on-defect high
pio run
```

## 6) Open the PR

- Target the **`fork-drift`** branch.
- Use a semantic title matching your commit format (e.g., `fix: avoid crash on malformed epub`).
- Fill out the PR template completely.
- Include reproduction and verification steps for bug fixes.

For community expectations, see [GOVERNANCE.md](../../GOVERNANCE.md).
