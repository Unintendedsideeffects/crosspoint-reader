# Plugin Picker Test Plan

## Pre-Build Validation

- [x] Configuration generator script runs without errors
- [x] All profiles generate valid configurations (lean, standard, full)
- [x] Custom feature selection works
- [x] Profile overrides work (e.g., `--profile full --disable markdown`)
- [x] Feature size estimates are calculated correctly
- [x] Build flags are formatted correctly in output

## Build Tests

### Lean Profile Build

```bash
uv run python scripts/generate_build_config.py --profile lean
uv run pio run -e custom
```

**Expected:**
- [  ] Build completes successfully
- [  ] Firmware size ~2.6MB
- [  ] No compilation errors
- [  ] All feature flags set to 0

**Verify on device:**
- [  ] EPUB reading works (14pt only)
- [  ] TXT reading works
- [  ] BMP sleep screens work
- [  ] PNG/JPEG sleep screens are ignored or show error
- [  ] Opening .md files shows "not supported" message
- [  ] Font size settings only show 14pt option

### Standard Profile Build

```bash
uv run python scripts/generate_build_config.py --profile standard
uv run pio run -e custom
```

**Expected:**
- [  ] Build completes successfully
- [  ] Firmware size ~6.2MB
- [  ] No compilation errors
- [  ] Extended fonts and image sleep enabled

**Verify on device:**
- [  ] EPUB reading works with multiple font sizes (12, 14, 16, 18pt)
- [  ] OpenDyslexic fonts available in settings
- [  ] PNG/JPEG sleep screens work
- [  ] BMP sleep screens work
- [  ] Opening .md files shows "not supported" message
- [  ] Todo defaults to .txt format

### Full Profile Build

```bash
uv run python scripts/generate_build_config.py --profile full
uv run pio run -e custom
```

**Expected:**
- [  ] Build completes successfully
- [  ] Firmware size ~6.4MB (tight headroom)
- [  ] No compilation errors
- [  ] All features enabled

**Verify on device:**
- [  ] All font sizes work (12-18pt)
- [  ] OpenDyslexic fonts work
- [  ] PNG/JPEG/BMP sleep screens work
- [  ] Markdown files render correctly
- [  ] Obsidian features work (wikilinks, callouts, etc.)
- [  ] Background web server stays running while reading
- [  ] WiFi file upload works during reading

### Custom Build Tests

#### Test: Extended Fonts Only
```bash
uv run python scripts/generate_build_config.py --enable extended_fonts
uv run pio run -e custom
```

**Verify:**
- [  ] Multiple font sizes available
- [  ] PNG/JPEG sleep images don't work
- [  ] Markdown files show error

#### Test: Markdown Only
```bash
uv run python scripts/generate_build_config.py --enable markdown
uv run pio run -e custom
```

**Verify:**
- [  ] Markdown files render
- [  ] Only 14pt font available
- [  ] PNG/JPEG sleep images don't work

## GitHub Actions Build Test

1. [  ] Push changes to fork (ensure you are on the `fork-drift` branch)
2. [  ] Navigate to Actions tab
3. [  ] Run "Build Custom Firmware" workflow
4. [  ] Select "standard" profile
5. [  ] Wait for build completion
6. [  ] Download artifact
7. [  ] Verify artifact contains:
   - firmware.bin
   - partitions.bin
   - platformio-custom.ini
8. [  ] Flash firmware.bin to device
9. [  ] Verify features match standard profile

> **Note:** Most active development and build testing should be performed on the `fork-drift` branch. See [docs/fork-strategy.md](fork-strategy.md) for more details.

## Plugin Picker Web UI Test

1. [  ] Open https://[username].github.io/crosspoint-reader/configurator/
2. [  ] Page loads without errors
3. [  ] Profile buttons work
4. [  ] Individual feature toggles work
5. [  ] Size estimate updates in real-time
6. [  ] Size bar visual updates correctly
7. [  ] "Build on GitHub Actions" button opens correct URL
8. [  ] URL includes selected features as query parameters
9. [  ] Test on mobile device (responsive design)
10. [  ] Test on desktop browser

## Graceful Degradation Tests

### Markdown Disabled

**Test opening .md file:**
- [  ] Shows clear error message "Markdown support not available"
- [  ] Doesn't crash
- [  ] Can navigate back to library

**Test Todo feature:**
- [  ] Defaults to .txt format instead of .md
- [  ] Todo files can be created and edited
- [  ] No crashes or errors

### Image Sleep Disabled

**Test with PNG sleep image:**
- [  ] PNG files in /sleep/ folder are ignored
- [  ] Falls back to BMP or default sleep screen
- [  ] No crashes

**Test with BMP sleep image:**
- [  ] BMP files work normally
- [  ] Sleep screen displays correctly

### Extended Fonts Disabled

**Test font settings:**
- [  ] Only shows available font sizes (14pt)
- [  ] Doesn't show unavailable options
- [  ] Can't accidentally select unavailable fonts

### Background Server Disabled

**Test reading mode:**
- [  ] Web server stops when entering reader
- [  ] Can't access web interface while reading
- [  ] Web server restarts when exiting reader
- [  ] No crashes

## Documentation Tests

- [  ] README.md "Custom Builds" section is clear
- [  ] BUILD_CONFIGURATION.md is comprehensive
- [  ] All links work
- [  ] Code examples are correct
- [  ] Plugin Picker link is correct
- [  ] No typos or formatting errors

## Regression Tests

Run with default build (`pio run -e default`) to ensure no breakage:

- [  ] All features work as before
- [  ] No new compilation warnings
- [  ] No size increase in default build
- [  ] All unit tests pass (if any exist)

## Performance Tests

- [  ] Lean profile build: Measure firmware size reduction
- [  ] Standard build: Verify boot time not impacted
- [  ] Full build: Ensure no memory issues
- [  ] Compare free heap between builds

## Known Issues / Notes

- Full profile has tight headroom on the 6.4MB partition - verify on hardware
- Feature detection at runtime not yet implemented (future enhancement)
- Web configurator assumes standard GitHub repository structure
